📚 Linear Regression on Student Marks Dataset
This project showcases the implementation of Simple Linear Regression to predict student marks based on the number of hours studied.

🎯 Objective
To build a linear regression model that predicts Marks based on Hours Studied, demonstrating the relationship between study time and academic performance.

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:

Hours – Number of hours a student studied

Marks – Marks obtained by the student



🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Model building and evaluation)

📝 Workflow
Data Import and Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Visualization

Scatter plots to understand relationships

Model Training

Simple Linear Regression using scikit-learn

Model Evaluation

R² Score, Mean Squared Error, and Residual plots

Prediction

Predict marks for new data (e.g., given a number of study hours)

📊 Results
A strong positive correlation was found between hours studied and marks obtained.

The model showed good predictive performance with high R² score and low error metrics.
